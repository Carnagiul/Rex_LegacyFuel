# Rex_LegacyFuel
LegacyFuel edit to give gas stations a tank that can run empty





Here is a heavy edit of LegacyFuel system that makes it so each gas station has its own fuel tank. I have dubbed it Rex_LegacyFuel just for ease of kn owing what one people are talking about on the forums

No need to add stations your self as it will auto add new stations once a player goes to them.

To refuel a station at this time you need to edit the stations.txt file and add fuel.

If you want a blip for the station you need to add it in the client were you see the rest of them. those are just blibs.

There is some code hashed out in the client.lua but it is for anti “BOOM BOOM STATION” It just makes the pumps god mode

If anyone wants to work on adding that as a job the triggers are in the files to add fuel to stations.

THIS IS NEEDS TO BE IN THE MAIN RESOURCE FOLDER FOR IT TO READ THE STATIONS.TXT!! NOT IN A SUBFOLDER
